# XMDE-UFS
XMDE-UpgradedFreshStable

XMDE short for XMonad Desktop Enviroment is a station with files containing customization and packages in a simple terminal commands so that i can do something else.

The UFS (Version 1) stands for Upgraded Fresh Stable, and the words are self-explained, Upgraded for perhaps Lesser or better packages, Fresh for a new UI feel and Stable as in the script may break less

How to get it installed?

---- Steps and checkmarks for installation ----

- Make sure you are on an arch based system
- Make sure you have git installed
- Check them keys because the first time i tried to install something it game me a key problem (sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux)
- After cloning this repo run the build.sh file WITHOUT SUDO, its going to manually ask you to give your password, this is so the aur packages are installed.
